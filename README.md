## What The Project Does

This project is a web platform for users to buy and sell virtual items, primarily focused on CS:GO skins. Key features include:

* **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login, including Google OAuth2.
* **Virtual Item Marketplace**: Browse, buy, and sell items.
* **User Profiles**: Manage personal information, view inventory, and transaction history.
* **Wallet System**: Users have wallets to manage their funds for transactions. Supports deposits via MoMo payment gateway.
* **Inventory Management**: Users can view their items and list them for sale.
* **Transaction History**: Tracks user's financial activities and item trades.
* **AI Chatbot (AlmaBot)**: Provides assistance to users for shop-related queries.
* **Notifications**: Informs users about important events.

The backend is built with Flask (Python), and the frontend is a Vue.js application. Nginx serves as a reverse proxy and hosts the frontend. PostgreSQL is used as the database. The entire application is containerized using Docker.

## Role of Each File

*(Refer to the Project Structure section above for detailed file roles. Key configuration and entry point files are highlighted below)*

* **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines and configures the services for the application (backend, database, nginx). It manages networking, volumes, and environment variables for these services.
* **`build.sh`**: A utility script that uses Docker Compose to build and start all defined services. This is the primary script for deploying the application.
* **`up.sh`**: A utility script that uses Docker Compose to start already built services. Useful for quickly bringing the application online without a full rebuild.
* **`backend/run.py`**: The main entry point for the Flask backend application.
* **`backend/app/__init__.py`**: Initializes the Flask application, loads configurations, sets up extensions (CORS, Limiter), and registers API blueprints.
* **`backend/app/global_config.py`**: Contains all critical configurations for the backend, including database credentials, JWT secrets, OAuth2 client details, API keys for external services (like AskYourDatabase for the chatbot and MoMo), and site URL settings.
* **`backend/app/models/Database.py`**: Handles the setup of the SQLAlchemy database engine and provides a way to get database sessions.
* **`backend/app/models/__init__.py`**: Initializes all SQLAlchemy models and creates the database tables based on these models. It also executes an initial SQL script (`init.sql`) to populate the database.
* **`backend/requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the backend to function.
* **`nginx/frontend/package.json`**: Lists JavaScript dependencies and scripts (like `dev`, `build`, `preview`) for the Vue.js frontend.
* **`nginx/frontend/vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for Vite, the build tool and development server used for the frontend. It includes settings for plugins (Vue, TailwindCSS), path aliases, and the development server.
* **`nginx/frontend/src/main.js`**: The entry point for the Vue.js frontend application. It initializes the Vue app, sets up the router, and integrates plugins like `vue3-google-login`.
* **`nginx/frontend/src/router/router.js`**: Defines all the client-side routes for the frontend application, mapping URLs to specific Vue components.

## How to Build and Run the Project

### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed.
* Ensure necessary ports (e.g., 80 for Nginx, 5432 for PostgreSQL) are available on the host machine.

### Build and Run

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Navigate to the project root directory (`NT208`).**
3.  **Frontend Development Note**:
    Given the current structure where frontend files are under `nginx/frontend/`, if you are developing the frontend and intend to see live changes, you would typically run the Vite development server.
    * Navigate to `nginx/frontend/`.
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
    * The `vite.config.js` specifies `allowedHosts` which might need adjustment based on your setup if accessing from other devices.

4.  **Build and start all services using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```
    This command executes `docker compose up --build`, which will:
    * Build the Docker images for the `backend` and `nginx` services as defined in their respective `Dockerfiles`.
    * Pull the `postgres:13` image for the `db` service.
    * Create and start containers for all services.
    * The backend will connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    * Nginx will act as a reverse proxy and serve the frontend application.

5.  **Accessing the Application:**
    Once the containers are up and running, the application should be accessible via `http://localhost` (or the configured domain/IP).

### Running without Rebuilding

If the images are already built and you just want to start the containers:

```bash
./up.sh
```

This command executes docker compose up

## Stopping the Application

To stop the running containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```
